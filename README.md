<p>a library for data processing and prediction</p>

<h2>Why creating this library ?</h2>

<p> Sklean has so many libraries and so many parameters. In addition, importation of these libraries requires knowledge of the full text, which is not feasible for everyone. Especially for me, who can't remember what he ate for lunch. This library will give you a template in the form of a jupyter notebook, and libraries that can be imported directly by simply specifying their name in jupyter. Thus simplifying the process, and making the jupyter notebook cleaner. </p>
